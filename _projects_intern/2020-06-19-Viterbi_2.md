Knowledge graphs are used to perform more informed predictions as well as more explainable predictions. Recent literature has seen a tremendous increase in using knowledge graphs for a variety of downstream tasks such as question answering and recommendation systems. But we observe that if we alter the original knowledge graph leaving very little structural or semantic information, still at inference time, the performance of these models are maintained. It is clear that these models are not faithfull when it comes to infering over these graph and what exactly causes the models using knowledge graphs to show an increase in performance of the various downstream tasks is still a mystery. We use simple heuristics such as deleting the edges or changing relation types of edges and even learned perturbation techniques to perturb almost the entire graph but observe almost similar performance (still better than those models that do not use knowledge graphs), so if there is no structural or semantic information left, what knowledge is being used by the model to depict similar performance?
