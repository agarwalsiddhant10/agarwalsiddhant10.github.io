I am a fourth year Dual Degree (BTech + MTech) student from the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur. My interests lie around Reinforcement Learning, Deep Learning, Explainable AI and Adversarial Attacks. I have worked in a wide variety of fields in Artificial Intelligence. In my internship at Carnegie Mellon University, I worked under the guidance of Prof Zico Kolter on Breaking Backdoored Classifiers. We showed that for any such classifier, it is not only the adversary who can break it, but they are fundamentally broken. I have worked on Visual Commonsense Reasoning and Showing the unfaithfulness of Knowledge Graph Models with Prof Xiang Ren in my internship at University of Southern California. I have been an active Member at Autonomous Ground Vehicles Research Group at IIT Kharagpur. Here I have worked on numerous robotics projects like Frenet Optimal Trajectory Planner, Traffic Sign Detection, Reinforcement Learning based Local Planners and Lane Segmentation.
