excerpt: 'With the advent of distributed systems, distributed file systems have become a budding area of research in operating systems. Distributed file systems allow a network of users access to more resources than is generally available to a single-user while allowing for the same user-facing functionality. Generally DFS defines a set of methods for managing the storage across different machines and providing the user with a unified view of the FS. They use the local file systems like ext4 or XFS for managing the low level storage in the different machines but this is slowly changing.'
