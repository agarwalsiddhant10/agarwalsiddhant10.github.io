The Intelligent Ground Vehicles Competition required us to build an autonomous ground vehicle that would run on a grass track with white lanes. There would be coloured bins that will act as obstacles. There can be a white poth-hole and a ramp present in the track as well. The track would also consist of a region that had no lanes but the vehicle had to navigate using GPS co-ordinates itself. Developed a robust lane detection and object detection pipeline using simple computer vision and image processing techniques. Used the TEB plannar to traverse the track once the lanes and obstacles had been identified. It fetched our team the Runners Up position at the Intelligent Ground Vehicles Competition, Michigan for two year (2018 and 2019).
