Lane detection is another important task in self driving vehicles. We use the TU-Simple dataset for our experiments. We replicate the results of two models EL-GAN and CAN-LFE on this dataset. We later try to perform domain adaptation using GANs and VAEs to generate images in different lighting conditions and improve the generalizability of the model.
