In urban and highway scenarios, "Velocity keeping", "Lane changing" and "Lane following" are common modes of operation of vehicles. Also most planners provide paths that do not consider the jerk observed by the vehicle. For commercial autonomous vehicles, minimizing jerk as well minimizing time of travel is essential. Frenet Optimal Trajectory Planner transforms the paths to the famous Frenet-Serret Frame with one axis being parallel to the global path and other perpendicular to it. It generates a quintic polynomial for estimating the perpendicular distance from the path. It can be shown that using quintic polynomial is minimal for minimizing jerk. Along with this it uses a quartic polynomial along the global path to minimize the total time of convergence. This dual objective is solved by sampling in a dynamic window. We later learn RL policies to minimize the sampling time.
